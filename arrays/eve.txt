We have to alter the color of every pixel with the color same as in {image[sr][sc]}
where sr -> row number, sc -> column number ; with the new color (in our case : 2)

We have to keep in mind that we won't change the color of pixel which is NOT in direct 
contact with the specified pixel i.e only pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. 

Approach : Using recursion
Store the color of current image in a variable presentColor
columns in columns variable, rows in rows variable
Pass it in helper function : changeColor

Base Case : If color of the pixel is same as presentColor, we need to change its color
 4 cases of recursion 

 1. Move Leftwards and check if color is same: if yes then do a recursive call on it
 2. Move Rightwards and check if color is same: if yes then do a recursive call on it
 3, 4. In the same way Upwards and Downwards making recursive calls on each pixel 

 return the array at the end
